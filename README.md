# contentrec-intoapi
Uses public datasets (available in repo) to construct a content based model to provide recommendations for film/show content. Takes in the product name as an input, and returns a list of 10 most likely similar products for the user.

I also plugged into an API on flask. Could have done django too, but went with flask since its a single use demonstration.
